Neuralgorithm:

The VNC protocol assumes that the server starts to negotiate with the
client by sending the largest protocol version number that the server
can understand. On the other hand, for layer-7 proxy, the client has
to start negotiation. So, in the L7-proxy version of VNC protocol,
the version number has to be set at a fixed number. For this purpose,
I modified RfbProto.java.
